    <h1>This is JS Multi-threading possible by making use of web-workers</h1>
    <h2>Look at the Console of your Browser</h2>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, a web worker is a separate thread that runs in the
      background, allowing you to perform tasks without blocking the main
      thread. This helps in keeping the user interface responsive, especially
      for computationally intensive tasks. Web workers can communicate with the
      main thread using a message-passing mechanism.
